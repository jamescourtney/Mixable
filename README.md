Mixable hopes to make service configuration easier. Mixable allows...

- Inferring XML schemas from XML documents, with limited required metadata. No need for XSD files!
- Chaining overrides of XML files in a validated, schematized way to produce derived, environment-specific configurations
- Generating XML parsers for those schemas in a variety of languages
